Purpose : To pinpoint the exact positions of a an arbitrary triplet of
          battleships on a (4x8) grid, making as few guesses as possible.

This aims to solve a battleship-like game that has a 4 row, 8 column grid,
in which the coordinates of 3 ships, each in their own square on the grid,
must be guessed together in 1 group in as few guesses as possible using
some limited feedback about the number of guesses that spotted ships within
0, 1 or 2 squares. To achieve this, firstly a data type representing a
location was devised to represent the 2 dimensions, followed by a gamestate.
To avoid array indexing of a grid, we generate all possible combinations
of correct triplets of locations, and filter them down with the following
strategy: Firstly, an initial guess is provided, which was determined
using some supplementary code on a couple sample targets and just picking
one that had a low turn count (<6) (it seemed to take too long to compute
all). This chose first guess provides a good starting point for eliminating
more 'inconsistent' squares, as described below. We then apply this guess
and get feedback about the number of guesses which are 0, 1, or 2 units'
distance away from the closest of the three ships. To reduce the search
space, for future guesses, we consider only those which, as targets togther
with the old guess, would have produced the same feedback triple i.e. are
'consistent'. Then from these 'future guesses', we select the optimal guess
by computing the expected/avg number of remaining candidates, if we were to
choose them, and selecting the guess with the lowest expected remaining
number. This continues until we find that there are 3 locations in the guess
that match the target triplet i.e. the entire guess matches.

{- Takes in a target, and a guess and returns a triplet (c0, c1, c2) where
c0 is the number of correct guesses, c1 is the number of guesses exactly 1
space away from a target, c2 is the number of guesses exactly 2 spaces away
from a target. Thus, feedback is _not_ commutative. Each individual guess
may only count for up to 1 target ship, so we take the minimum distance for
a given guess to all the targets, which means 0 <= c0 + c1 + c2 <= 3.

{- | Provides the initial guess of 3 locations for the simulation, and populates
the gamestate with all combinations of 3 locations to serve as the starting
point for all possible next guesses, that will be pared down in nextGuess.
The initial guess is deleted to prevent re-using it. The initial guess
A2, F1, H4 was found by enumerating the first 1000 triplets in initialState
against a sample point C3, D4, F3 and choosing a low guess (with 3 guesses)
Even if an individual guess is not slow, running 4960 together takes a while
hence only the first 1000 were run: this is OK as there is board symmetry.

{- | Given a guess triplet of locations, a GameState, as well as the feedback
obtained using said guess, generate an optimal new guess and an updated
GameState. To get the optimal guess, firstly we keep only consistent
guesses - which means that if they were targets of the old guess, they would
produce the same feedback value. These candidate guesses are stored in
preState'. Secondly, we take the candidate guesses from preState', and
attempt to exploit the ability to remove symmetry: the set of guesses that
yield the same feedback will leave you with the same candidate guess set/
space. Hence we store the expected # of remaning candidates for each
candidate guess (should it go ahead), along with the guess itself for easy
retrieval. Then, make the candidate guess with the lowest expected # cands
the new guess, and update the gameState. Note that using `delete` rather
than an extra condition in the list comprehension seems to run a bit faster.
